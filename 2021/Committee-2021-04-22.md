# JS Committee Meeting - 22.04.2021

## nz.js(con); update

* Jen gave a progress report:
  - Sponsorship going OK, trying to get one more old sponsor
  - Subissions were a bit flat for the first end of CFP, but have picked up now with the extended deadline so looking in good shape
  - Venue has been a bit slack about getting me quotes, AV quote has now come through and looks good, still chasing catering
  - Hoping to use Next Day video again, dependant on travel bubble
  - Aiming to get tickets up for sale this weekend
 
## Issues from the society meetings tracker

### Issue 47 - [Get history on Slack](https://github.com/JavaScript-NZ/Society-Meetings/issues/47)

* Silverstipe Slack channel uses some custom tooling that we might be able to use
* $20 a month cost for hosting
* Can't get back past history but will start logging it going forwards
* Silverstripe f/e
* Try it for three months?
* Let people know what's happening [Stevie to draft something]
 
### Issue 79 - [Reducing channel count within Slack](https://github.com/JavaScript-NZ/Society-Meetings/issues/79)

* Jen presented a draft message to use in channels (rather than a technical solution):
  - :wave: hey all, this channel has been pretty quiet recently. We're having a bit of a tidy up of low-use channels :broom:, so unless anyone particularly objects, in a few days I'll close this one up.
Feel free to use the main #general channel, or reopen this channel if you like :smile:
* We can put to put this in channels as we see inactive ones [Jen]
 
## Other business

* Admitting people into the Slack - are the hurdles too much?
  - Do we want to turn off the robot? We used to have a problem with spammers
  - For now we will leave the auto inviter on, but approve everyone, and reasses how that's going later

* End of FY
  - Need to file GST by the end of May [Aurynn to follow up with accountant]
