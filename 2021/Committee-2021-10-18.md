# JS Committee Meeting - 18.10.2021

## nz.js(con); update

* The conference was broadly a success - we sold out tickets and got favourable responses to the feedback survey
* The situation with the AU traveller who tested positive for COVID-19 was quite stressful, but the comms we gave a the time seem to have been in line with government advice
* Although GST is still pending we seem to have made more of a "profit" on the conference than planned. This is due to a number of factors:
  - selling out all tickets
  - a larger balance of full price tickets compared to student tickets than anticipated
  - an under-utilisation of the financial aid fund despite active pushing
  - several late sponsors
  - a lowered appetite for risk due to the COVID situation meant Jen aimed for more of a buffer than usual
* The committee will need to make a decision about what to do with these funds - they could potentially be rolled forwards to a future event
* We'll have a clearer picture of the balance after the next statement from the accountant

In regards to a future event:
* Jen is unwilling to be conference director again, but is happy to mentor someone (or someones) else willing to act as director. This doesn't need to be someone on the committee.
* Jen to draft a request for interest in running an event next year to run past the committee asynchronously

## Accounting update

* All post conference receipts and bill payments are sorted
* Accountant is getting GST prepped
* Aurynn now has access to the bank accounts in her position as Treasurer

### Issue 47 - [Get history on Slack](https://github.com/JavaScript-NZ/Society-Meetings/issues/47)

* No update as Stevie unable to make meeting
* We'll ask him for an asynchronous update

### Issue 79 - [Reducing channel count within Slack](https://github.com/JavaScript-NZ/Society-Meetings/issues/79)

* The number of channels has been reduced by us manually having a bit of clearout
* Encouraging people to use #general more has had mixed success
* Jen suggests setting up a bot to say hi to new folks and introduce themselves in #general per some other NZ based Slack channels - she will investigate and report back to the committee.

### Any other business

* n/a
