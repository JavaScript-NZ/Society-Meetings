## Minutes

#### President's statement:

Fabian as president, paraphrased from his statement.

* Last society engagement we worked on was the conference in 2021, since then we've wound down as a society and we haven't really pushed for the need to have a society in general. 
* Some consideration among the existing committee about whether an incorporated society is required. We haven't been able to maintain the website, hosting and email.
* This requires an investment of time to reboot and the current committee hasn't been able to find the time. 
* If we were to engage if any future events we'd need a large investment of personal time from interested people to carry that forwards. 
* The existing achievements of the Society still stand as successes

Discussion about the responsibilities involved in the Secretary and Treasurer position.

Pause to wait for anyone to nominate themselves for Secretary and Treasurer as there were no prior nominees.

Discussion around moving straight to the special vote in light of the fact no one wants to take on those roles.
