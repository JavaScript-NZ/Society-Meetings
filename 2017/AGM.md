> Chairs address
> `JavaScript NZ has had an eventful year. If I was to use a word to sum up the last year I'd say that we've been solidifying the setup and processes of the society to achieve a society that is self sustaining and valuable for it's membership.
>
> * Our most momentous moment of the year was the culmination of an awful lot of work by Jen and an awful lot of volunteers, so we want to convey our huge thanks and congratulations to Jen and the whole team our first successful nz.js(con); we hope to see many more over the next few years.
> * We've been actively involved agin this year in Nodebots and love seeing the growth in those events around the country.
> * We've welcomed new members and we're grateful for everyone supporting the society
> * We've been committed to improving our processes over the year with regards to how the committee run, how we maintain a welcoming society for all members, and how we proceed to maintain an engaged and active society
>
> We'll be focused on many things over the next year including the following
>
> * Maintaining baseline revenue and sponsorship to enable us to function as a society
> * Building on the success of nz.js(con); and building another great event in 2018
> * Increasing the number of members and building the value for existing members
