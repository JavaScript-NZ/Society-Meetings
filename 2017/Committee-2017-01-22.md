# Minutes

## Current Accounts

Alex has had a run through of the budget - all is on track :) Membership - we haven't asked for reoccurring fees yet for a number of people so the numbers are a bit off. 2016-1027 financial year has seen $260 so far. Budget is $1400.

Nodebots is going well. $5k in sponsorship is desired. So far we have $3k. Ticket sails and events should push this up. Nodebots Wellington has got 3k in sponsorship so far, 1k over budget :)

Everything will also have a GST number now as we are GST registered (including Nodebots ticket sales).

## Conference status update

Pretty good shape. Woo! Venue, catering, AV folks is all sorted.

Tickets are on sale now - y'all should keep tweeting. 64 people have registered so far. Owen reckons this is a good number and this will ramp up later.

Also 64 talks submitted. Reasonably high number of international submissions. CFPs close this Friday. On track for filling all the talks.

Keynotes are confirmed - announcements will be near the end of this week so stay tuned.

Probably also need to think about the 2018 conference. Swapping cities is a good idea and will be bought up next committee meeting.

Have also raised over our budgeted sponsorship amount but even so Jen is still looking for another silver sponsor.

## Website

Let's go live - has been sorted for a while. No one had any issues with this so yay!

## Membership fee [#52](https://github.com/JavaScript-NZ/Society-Meetings/issues/52)

$35 was the common answer to what people thought the cost should be. General consensus is that it should be as cheap as possible while allowing us to work on things in the background that is beneficial the committee as a while.

Still a question about what people actually get. Jen mentioned that concrete benefits don't seem to be necessary as much as people knowing they are helping the community.

Student membership of, say $5, was also raised as an option. As long as "student" isn't only teriary students - people may still be in a difficult position. Don't want to be driven by only having people in the society who can afford it. We don't (or shouldn't) check their "student" status anyway. Maybe "student" isn't the best term to use. Stevie thought we could have a default price ($20, $35, whatever) but people can really pay what they want. Or maybe people could pay more if they like.

Motion passed - scale of default $35, minimum of $5 (or whatever the minimum fee is when we take GST, accountants fees, etc into account).

James to take care of updating the site for this once we have a minimum value sussed,

## Subscription system [#54](https://github.com/JavaScript-NZ/Society-Meetings/issues/54)

Stripe seems like a good option. We should be able to set up a second Stripe account (the first being the conference site).

James to start taking care of this and integrating this into Keystone.

## Slack history [#47](https://github.com/JavaScript-NZ/Society-Meetings/issues/47)

If we want to get a not-for-profit status then the account owner needs to get in touch with Slack.

## Tech community awards [#49](https://github.com/JavaScript-NZ/Society-Meetings/issues/49)

Alex doesn't have enough time to tackle this, but Anna has taken over it. Would be nice to do something in conjunction with the conference. Something small, possibly two categories - one for OSS participation, and one for promoting and educating JavaScript in NZ. How do we nominate? How do we chose the winner? And do we have a "prize" or is it purely symbolic?

Owen brought up the idea that the international keynote speakers could be the judging committee. Anna had a smiliar idea about using speakers or the committee as a panel Stevie thought maybe the attendants of the conference could be the ones that vote. Maybe a box on the day of the conference where people submit votes?

James should throw something up on the website too.

Lets get something sorted in the next couple of weeks.

## Setting up the society as a non-profit [#53](https://github.com/JavaScript-NZ/Society-Meetings/issues/53)

Being a charity does give us a few benefits. Like getting GST refunds, and the perception of being a charity when asking for sponsorship (i.e. - companies sponsoring us could get tax back). But there needs to be a number of people involved and there are more legal goings on. Also a slow process (like 6 months or so).

Do we want to deal with the overhead? May need to get a bit of legal advice.

Owen's thought is that the increase in budget may not be worth the overhead we have to go through. Prob also need the recurring status stuff sorted out.

Revisit this in a few months or so.

## Corporate society sponsorship [#45](https://github.com/JavaScript-NZ/Society-Meetings/issues/45) [#46](https://github.com/JavaScript-NZ/Society-Meetings/issues/46)

What do we offer and what are the levels? Nothing much has changed since the last meeting as we're still not 100% on what we offer.

Proposal to wait until the site is up, have the conference, and then come back to this.

## Learning materials [#38](https://github.com/JavaScript-NZ/Society-Meetings/issues/38)

Park this for the moment. Motion passed

## Farewells
