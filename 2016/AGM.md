## Society report

Owen presented the folllowing report:

JavaScript NZ Incorporated Society is now 20 months old and we're having our second AGM. But in reality the society has been operating at full capacity for less than a year.

As a society we're tasked with activities that grow the JavaScript development community within NZ and we think our first real year of operation has been a great success.

We've managed to put together some great Nodebots events, thanks to the dedicated team of enthusiasts (Alex Gibson, Elf Eldridge, Mayur Panchal, Jacob Duval amongst others) who run them (and we owe them all big thanks) and we're on track to hold our first conference in 2017 thanks to the efforts of Jen and others. We now have a membership base to allow us to grow as a society and a Slack community of nearly 300 that has a wide variety of developers representing lots of companies and roles throughout New Zealand.

We see our challenges going forward: 
* Maintaining and growing momentum around our events (Nodebots and JavaScript Conference)
* Building an engaged society membership and building out meaningful benefits of membership
* Maintaining and encouraging an active committee despite people's ongoing commitments elsewhere
* Building up sources of income to help us benefit members and others in the community through sponsorship

We have had a good start to the society and we'd like to thank each and every one of our members for their support.

## Any other business

While there are two outstanding items that need discussing (https://github.com/JavaScript-NZ/Society-Meetings/milestone/7) it was decided to defer these to the next committee meeting in approximately a month, in order to onboard the new committee members first.
