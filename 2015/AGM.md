# Minutes

## State of the Society

Running for a year now. Now have group of official paid membership, which gives us an appropriate number of members needed for member voting.

This is the 3rd meeting we've had, but previous meetings have been finding our feet and working through processes - the back and forth needed to properly get the society running. Now that we have paid membership, we can finally have a proper AGM.

Still finding our feet. We've existed and been receiving sponsorship for about a year. This sponsorshop has enabled us to run some Nodebots events. We've been taking paid membership for about 3 months.

## Financials

### Society
This is primarily membership, but includes expenses of incorporating the society and for the domain name. Prediction is for about 50 members next year, totaling $1000 in membership fees (note that this is deductible from our tax).

#### Nodebots
This has been the primary income source. Has been running one year, and has raised approx $5600. Most of which has some from corporate sponsorship, with only $660 coming from event tickets.

Each Nodebots event has expenses. We burn through a lot of gear - stuff breaks, Arduinos get burnt out, servos get burnt out, etc. Ticket costs are aimed at covering this. Ticket cost is $15, but with an option for free tickets for that that can't afford it - this averages to about $10/attendee. So we break-even at around 20 attendees, and start making some profit for higher numbers of attendees - which goes towards buying better gear.

Aim is to run around 12 events over the next year.

See report for basic inventory - only includes major items. Does not include items such as batteries, duct tape, popsicle sticks, etc.

Income closely matches expenses. Income directed at Notebots goes towards replacing worn out equipment/buying new equipment.

### NodeJS Wellington
This has been run through the Society as an experiment, to test how sponsorship could work and if having a society behind an event would encourage corporate sponsorship. Catalyst IT and Fairfax Media provided sponsorship ($600 each). Catalyst IT were willing/able to sponsor regardless, but having the society behind the event made a significant difference to Fairfax Media in organising sponsorship. From this, the experiment was a success.

Expenses average $120 per event, split evenly between pizza and beverages. For a planned 10 events per year, this lets us break even with the sponsorship amount.

### Tax
Tax we expect to pay this year is $91.28. This comes from sponsorship and approx $340 in bank.

Still sorting out IRD number, so can't yet pay the tax. Have the cash in the bank for the expected tax amount.

### Bank
We currently have $1,444.28 in the bank.

### Accountant
Financial report this year was done with assistance from Owen, and this was a relatively simple year compared to what we're expecting in the future. Working on cash basis, which is both simpler and lowers the amount of tax we pay. Going forward, with more membership, more corporate sponsorship, more complexity etc, it may be safer to get an accountant. We may be able to find sponsorship solely to cover accountant fees.

### Financial year
Currently our financial year starts 1st October, however this doesn't match IRD's financial year for tax - which complicates things. It's suggested we match our financial year to IRD's financial year (1st April). To be discussed next committee meeting.
